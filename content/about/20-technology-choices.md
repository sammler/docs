- CSS framework: [Clarity](https://vmware.github.io/clarity/)
- Storage: [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo)
- Messaging: [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)
- Containerization: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- Service orchestration: [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
