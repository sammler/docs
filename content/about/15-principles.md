While working on _sammler_ I have defined some principles, I try to follow:

- Everything is open sourced.
- Follow a Readme Driven Development.
    - Publish everything: my progress, failure, thoughts, decisions.  
    (Will be fun in a year from now to especially read all the silly decisions ;-))
- Use as much existing solutions as possible, focus on assembling, rather than writing new code.
- All activities should be continuously tested and deployed to the cloud.
- The entire solution needs to multi-tenant enabled.
- Embrace the concept of microservices.
- Don't introduce any dependencies on cloud providers such as Amazon, Azure, etc.
- Automate, automate, automate.
