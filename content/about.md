_sammler_ is my very personal attempt to bring business life, social activities and IoT together.

I am fully adopting cloud computing as consumer and producer, but I hate it, that I don't have all the data available at a fingertip  - just to be able to analyze them.  
Furthermore I am fully adopting IoT, collecting already more than 1GB each week.

So I need a solution to constantly collect and analyze all the data, their correlation, just to get interesting insights. Otherwise data is useless.  

The goal of this project:

- Analyze activities in the three different areas (business life, social activities, IoT).
- Create a pluggable system, so that it can be easily extended.
- Be able to have access and analyze the full history in all areas.

## The Ultimate (but very ambitious) Goal

Ideally, sammler evolves over time to be a framework. A framework one can use to easily *collect and analyze* data.  
I fully acknowledge, that this is a long way to go. But without ambitious goal, there is nothing great to aim for ...

## But, wait ...  

There is also another reason for _sammler_:  
As I am constantly testing new architectural and technical approaches, I just need a playground to test and validate technologies in general and in particular cloud related solutions.
The entire setup of _sammler_ is also my reference implementation of a microservices based architecture, using some of the cutting edge solutions out there.

Finally, don't take the entire project [too seriously](https://circleci.com/blog/its-the-future/).


## Technology choices

Over time, I have made a few technology-choices, which are documented [here](/about/technology-choices)
