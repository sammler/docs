## Goal

_strategy-twitter_ has some pretty simple goals:

- Track the historic data of your Twitter account on a daily basis
- Track and analyze the amount of following/followers/lists
- Be able to identify who is following/unfollowing you

## The Challenge

Actually, tracking the followers by day using a simple Python script or something similar is not a big challenge.
It's actually getting much more complicated if you add some of the following requirements:


- Provide a fully multi-tenant solution
- Take care of the rate-limits of Twitter

## Getting Started

```sh
$ npm run dc-up
```

## Configuration

- `PORT` - defaults to `3000`

## Source Code

All source code can be found in the following repository: [sammler/strategy-twitter](https://github.com/sammler/strategy-twitter)
