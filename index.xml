      <description>While working on sammler I have defined some principles, I try to follow:
 Everything is open sourced. Follow a Readme Driven Development.  Publish everything: my progress, failure, thoughts, decisions.
(Will be fun in a year from now to especially read all the silly decisions ;-))  Use as much existing solutions as possible, focus on assembling, rather than writing new code. All activities should be continuously tested and deployed to the cloud.</description>

      <description> Some opinionated assumptions and technology choices have been made. But this might change over time.
 Programming/scripting languages: JavaScript / TypeScript, GoLang UI framework: Angular + TypeScript CSS framework: Clarity Storage: MongoDB Messaging: RabbitMQ Containerization: Docker Service orchestration: Docker Swarm, Kubernetes Deployment: Packer, Terraform, Vagrant  All other decisions will be documented over time.

      <description>I have spent most of 2017 to get some of the basics done for sammler. Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to bring everything together.
Therefore phases have been defined for the next development steps.
Phase 1: Core Have some scheduled tasks defined (file based, just a YML file) (=jobs) in the scheduler-service Run those scheduled tasks, publishing messages to RabbitMQ Periodically listening to the tasks and executing Writing the results to a log-service Show the results of the log-service in a UI Log both locally or using a LaaS provider  Show the log results in some basic UI  Phase 2: Runnable Stack scheduler-service with predefined jobs (.</description>

      <description>sammler is my very personal attempt to bring business life, social activities and IoT together.
I am fully adopting cloud computing as consumer and producer, but I hate it, that I don&amp;rsquo;t have all the data available at a fingertip - just to be able to analyze them.
Furthermore I am fully adopting IoT, collecting already more than 1GB each week.
So I need a solution to constantly collect and analyze all the data, their correlation, just to get interesting insights.</description>

      <description>Primarily I do - especially at the beginning and in the next months - not expect any contributions, and that&amp;rsquo;s fine.
I might pretty slowly progress on this project, as this is just a private project, only working on it in my free time.
But stop: You might have similar requirements and interest, so please do not hesitate to drop me a line and add your thoughts.
Even if you do not want to actively participate, I am very interested in listening to your opinion and your related requirements.</description>

      <description>As of now, the entire deployment can be configured using an .env file. There is an .env file for each of the environments.
Versions of Docker Images # MongoDB (docker image sammlerio/mongodb) export MONGODB_VERSION=3.5.13 # Logstash (docker image log export LOGSTASH_VERSION=5.5-alpine # RabbitMQ (docker image sammlerio/rabbitmq) export RABBITMQ_VERSION= # sammler/log-service export S5R_LOG_SERVICE_VERSION=latest # sammler/scheduler-service export S5R_SCHEDULER_SERVICE_VERSION=latest  Services Configuration Most of the services share some common configuration options, passed in by using environment variables.</description>

      <description>The following environments are available:
 dev - Local VirtualBox environment. stage-local - Private VirtualBox environment (different machine). stage - Staging environment in the public cloud (DigitalOcean). prod - Production environment (DigitalOcean).  Dev  Uses Docker for Mac/Windows to deploy to a local Docker Swarm.
 All deployment scripts are available as bash-scripts.  Stage-Local  Same as Dev, but deployment to a different machine (in my intranet).  This environment can be ignored, I am using it primarily to save hosting costs.</description>

      <description>Goal strategy-twitter has some pretty simple goals:
 Track the historic data of your Twitter account on a daily basis Track and analyze the amount of following/followers/lists Be able to identify who is following/unfollowing you  The Challenge Actually, tracking the followers by day using a simple Python script or something similar is not a big challenge. It&amp;rsquo;s actually getting much more complicated if you add some of the following requirements:</description>
