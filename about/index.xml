      <description>While working on sammler I have defined some principles, I try to follow:
 Everything is open sourced. Follow a Readme Driven Development.  Publish everything: my progress, failure, thoughts, decisions.
(Will be fun in a year from now to especially read all the silly decisions ;-))  Use as much existing solutions as possible, focus on assembling, rather than writing new code. All activities should be continuously tested and deployed to the cloud.</description>

      <description>I have spent most of 2017 to get some of the basics done for sammler. Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to bring everything together.
Therefore phases have been defined for the next development steps.
Phase 1: Core Have some scheduled tasks defined (file based, just a YML file) (=jobs) in the scheduler-service Run those scheduled tasks, publishing messages to RabbitMQ Periodically listening to the tasks and executing Writing the results to a log-service Show the results of the log-service in a UI Log both locally or using a LaaS provider  Show the log results in some basic UI  Phase 2: Runnable Stack scheduler-service with predefined jobs (.</description>
